                    <h3>What Causes Back Strain?</h3>
                    <p>
                      A prevalent cause of backbone issues is low back strain or
                      lumbar strain. This occurs when muscles or ligaments in
                      the lower back get overextended or ripped. You may suffer
                      from lumbar strain if you have lifted heavy objects,
                      maintained a certain posture for a very long time, or been
                      involved in aggressive sports or other activities. Your
                      risk factors may include a low back curve, weak belly
                      muscles, and a forwardly slanted hip.
